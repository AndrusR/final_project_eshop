    <h4><b>The Story of ShipHappens</b></h4>
    <p>In the spring of 2024, four passionate maritime enthusiasts, Kristiane Karine Kand, Indrek Maam√§gi,<br>
        Andrus Raudsepp, and Mihkel Pisa, came together to realize a shared dream.<br>
        They envisioned a company that would not only sell boats,<br>
        yachts, and ships but also embody the luxury and freedom that the sea offers.<br>
        This vision birthed ShipHappens.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4><b>Launch and Growth</b></h4>
    <p>From its inception, ShipHappens was not just about selling boats; it was about creating an experience.<br>
        The founders wanted their customers to feel the thrill of the sea, the luxury of a well-crafted yacht,<br>
        and the trust in a reliable ship. They built a showroom that was more like a gallery, where each boat was a masterpiece.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>In its first year, ShipHappens saw tremendous growth. Their commitment to quality and customer satisfaction<br>
        quickly established them as a trusted name in the maritime industry.<br>
        Word spread, and soon, ShipHappens was attracting clients from all over the world,<br>
        each looking to own a piece of the luxury that only ShipHappens could offer.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4><b>Beyond Sales</b></h4>
    <p>ShipHappens wasn't just a business; it was a community. The founders hosted events,<br>
        sailing workshops, and luxury sea tours. They partnered with yacht clubs and sailing schools,<br>
        creating a network of maritime enthusiasts who shared their passion.<br>
